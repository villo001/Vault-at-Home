# Vault-at-Home Personal Shelter

A Fallout 4 mod implementing a network of connected old style player homes like the house in Fallout 3 Megaton City.

As far as these player homes aren't settlements you can't build anything in them, butthey've all workbenches (chems, weapons, etc.) and these workbenches are linked together via cluod storage (i.e. every workbengh in every player home share the same invertory).

Currently the mod have no DLC requirements, only the base game.
