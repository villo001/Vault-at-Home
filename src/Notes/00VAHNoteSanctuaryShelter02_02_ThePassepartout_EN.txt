I need local tunnel access, I can't wander around, selling my chems like I use to do before the bombs, too many desperate on the surface.

I need the Vault-at-Home passepartout.

Jahani has it, he came in my shelter using tunnels to buy psycho, that junkie, but he never forget that key home.

Maybe I can take it when he leave his daughter home alone, his shelter has an easy lockpicking...

And maybe I can grab Caitie too, that cute little slut...
